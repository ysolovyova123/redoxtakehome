# Notes on this project

- GitHub repo link: https://github.com/ysolovyova123/redoxtakehome. Currently public for your visibility, will change to private once we are done discussing it so that others can't cheat!
- The ask: build a tool to analyze pull request traffic for a Github organization. Write some code that will retrieve every pull request for the Ramda organization using the Github web API and store the results in memory
- My app: This app allows a user to view all pull requests (PRs) for the Ramda organization (https://github.com/ramda), and filter PRs based on their status (open, closed, or all)
- The app requires a GitHub token to fully access the API (input in line 46 under client > components > App). I have removed mine for security, but a token will need to be entered to fully access the app
- Once token has been entered, run npm i to install the dependencies, and run `npm run start-server` to start the app
- I used the GitHub Search API to retrieve all the pull requests for the Ramda organization, regardless of repository
- I ran into the issue of retrieving all results (there are 1,977 total pull requests, both open and closed) for Ramda
  - The search API shows a maximum of 100 results per page, therefore I could not use just one fetch call to get data where the PRs exceeded 100. I went around this by editing the URLs in the fetch call with page numbers until all results were retrieved
  - The GitHub Search API provides up to 1,000 results for each search, so the most I was able to retrieve and store in memory for future evaluation was 1,000 pull requests out of the total 1,977. Source: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/search
  - Regardless of the limit, all pull requests queried by a certain status are stored in state as 'fullPrs' - see line 14 in Components > App.js
  - These results can then be used for whatever further analysis we need
  - A user who in the app changes the status selection of the PR (e.g. initially selecting 'all' pull requests but then switching to only 'closed' pull requests) will reset the fullPrs array in the state to an empty array, and this array will then be filled only with the PRs for the newly selected PR state. That way you are not overwriting our PR array with duplicate data
- Enjoy!
